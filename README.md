## Updates

- Oct-2018
improve active train location
move trains smoothly to the new position
station info when selected
more space for the map
change train icons
debug mode when clicking the legend station icon

# Known limitations
last leg is always missing (bart does not provide this info)
the Antioch / SFO-Milbrae line is messy, since trains go/return to/from SFIA and BLBR
in Antioch trains always leave with destination MLBR, and then it changes when they reach PITT
